-- HR Manager dashboard support.
--
-- 1. managed_user_ids(): the profiles an active hr_manager manages (everyone
--    in their own team, including themselves). SECURITY DEFINER so it can be
--    used inside RLS policies without recursive policy evaluation, and
--    set-returning so `x in (select public.managed_user_ids())` is evaluated
--    once per query rather than once per row.
-- 2. manager_select_team_* policies: a manager can read their team members'
--    sourcing data. Like the admin_select_* policies from 0003 this is
--    additive and redundant with 0001's `team_select_*` (using true) today —
--    it's what keeps manager visibility working once those blanket policies
--    are replaced by owner/team-scoped ones.
-- 3. team_sourcing_files(): the manager "sourcing files" table, one row per
--    search run owned by a team member, with per-file aggregates and all
--    filters applied in SQL. SECURITY INVOKER: RLS decides which teams and
--    runs a caller can see, so a manager passing another team's id gets
--    nothing back.
